I will be using the dataset on Housing Prices in California found on Kaggle with a creative Commons Public Domain License

"This dataset is based on data from the 1990 California Census, and incluides metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing proice for each block group in California.
Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data., and each block typically has between 600 to 3000 people."
